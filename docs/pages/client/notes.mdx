# Notes

## Names

### Geofences

Kōji requires that all geofence names be unique. If you attempt to import any fences with names that already exist in the database, the existing ones will be overwritten with the incoming ones. This limitation is in place to make the API more accessible and to save you headaches in the long run, such as when you attempt to assigning referenced properties in the Admin Panel.

Please view [API Params](../api-reference/params) for more information about how you can manipulate the `name` property of a geofence when making API calls.

If the API params are not enough to satisfy the requirements of your project, you can also add an override `name` property to your geofence. More details below in the [Properties](#properties) section.

### Routes

Unlike Geofences, Kōji does not enforce unique names when it comes to creating routes.

Since all routes are required to be associated with a geofence, Kōji has a special built in function for ensuring that keeping them in sync is as painless as possible.

If the routes associated with a geofence share the same name as that geofence, their name will be updated whenever the geofence's name is updated. This is a great way to keep your routes organized and synced up with the scanner.

### Properties

Properties can have duplicate names, however they still must have a unique combination of `name` and `category` values. For example, you can have a property with the name `parent` and the category set to `database` and another with the name `parent` and the category set to `string`. However, you cannot have two properties with the name `parent` and the category `database`.

While it is generally recommended to use the `database` category whenever possible in order to reduce manual edits whenever you change a geofence's property, such as its name, adding an override property such as a string based `name` can sometimes help for unique situations depending on what your project's endpoints are expecting.

## Scanner Integration

### API Syncing

While Kōji does connect directly to your scanner's database, most scanners have their geofences or routes loaded into memory and must reload these in order to make use of the latest changes. Instead of restarting your scanner process, you can setup Kōji to call the refresh endpoint automatically whenever a geofence or route is updated in the scanner database.

1. In the Admin Panel, navigate to the `projects` page.
1. Edit (or create) a scanner project
1. Set `scanner` to true
1. Add the `api_endpoint` value, a hint is provided for both RDM and Dragonite scanner endpoints
1. Add the `api_key` value, a hint is provided for both RDM and Dragonite scanner endpoints

Now when you click the `Sync` button, either next to the respect project, geofence, or route, Kōji will automatically call this endpoint after saving the changes to the scanner database, making them immediately available to the scanner to use!

### Default Templates

Since most scanners have many other properties associated with their geofences and routes, Kōji provides a way to automatically add these properties to your geofences and routes when they are created.

- If using Dragonite, in the Dragonite Admin panel create a new `area` named `Default` and set any properties that you want, such as worker counts, to be added to all geofences and routes that are saved from Kōji.
- If using RDM, you will need to name the files a little differently. For each available instance mode, you will need to take note of its acronym, below is the code that Kōji uses for your reference:

| Mode                 | Acronym |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| auto_quest           | AQ      |
| circle_pokemon       | CP      |
| circle_smart_pokemon | CSP     |
| circle_raid          | CR      |
| circle_smart_raid    | CSR     |
| pokemon_iv           | IV      |
| leveling             | L       |
| auto_tth             | ATTH    |
| auto_pokemon         | AP      |

- From the RDM admin panel, you will need to create instances based on this template: `Default_{acronym}`. For example, if you want to set a default `auto_quest` instance, you would create an instance named `Default_AQ`.
- Now when you save a geofence or route from Kōji, it will automatically add the properties from the `Default_{acronym}` area to the geofence or route.

## Active vs Inactive Routes in the Kōji Client

For performance reasons, the client makes use of active and inactive routes. Only one route can be active at a time. You can set in the drawer whether you want routes to become active from either clicking on them or hovering (default). When a route is active, you can use the Leaflet editing tools on the right to modify the route. When a route is inactive, you cannot make changes to it, other than merging with other routes.
