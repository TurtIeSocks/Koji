# Map

## Drawer

### Drawing Options

- Snappable
  - Drawing and editing Polygons snaps them to other Polygons when hovering near them
- Continue Drawing
  - Keeps the current drawing mode activates after completing a shape
- Radius
  - Global radius of the circles drawn
  - Sets all current and future circles
- Activate
  - DOM event for setting the active route on the map
  - Only one route can be active at a time
  - This is currently a "hack" to save on performance when rendering multiple
    Distance Colors
  - Set unlimited rules for coloring the line strings between circles on your routes to easily visualize the distance in meters between each

### Calculations

- Mode
  - `Bootstrap` - creates systematic patterns to cover all drawn Polygons on the map in a uniform manner
  - `Cluster` - clusters the points of the selected category in all drawn Polygons on the map
  - `Route` - clusters and routes the points using OR-Tools
- Category
  - Select the category/table for the clustering algorithm to read from the database
  - `Fort` will include both Pokestops and Gyms
- Strategy
  - `Radius` - clusters based on the selected radius
  - `S2` - clusters based on the selected S2 cell level and size
- Radius
  - Radius that the clustering algorithms should use
- S2 level
  - S2 cell level that the clustering algorithms should use
- S2 size
  - How many cells to cluster together per hop, e.g. `9x9`

## Recommended Settings

Below are three community‚Äìtuned example configurations you can apply under **Calculations** to get up and running quickly. Feel free to tweak them for your scanner density or area size.

---

### 1. Area Bootstrap ‚Äî Ideal for initial spawnpoint discovery

| Field     | Value         |
|-----------|---------------|
| Mode      | `Bootstrap`   |
| Strategy  | `Radius`      |
| Radius    | `70`          |
| Sort by   | `None`        |
| **Note**  | No optimization‚Äîsequential route, longer scan time. |

| Cluster mode        | `Balanced`   |
| Cluster split level | `1`          |
| Center clusters     | Off          |

| Field               | Value        |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Mode                | `Cluster`    |
| Category            | `Pokestop`   |
| Strategy            | `Radius`     |
| Radius              | `80`         |
| Min points          | `1`          |
| Cluster mode        | `Balanced`   |
| Cluster split level | `1`          |
| Center clusters     | Off          |
| Sort by             | `TSP`        |
| Route split level   | `1`          |

> **Tip:** These examples balance coverage and optimization‚Äîadjust the radius, min-points, or routing to dial in performance for your network and area size.

### Clustering Options

Most these options are up for interpretation on which results are best for your area. Some areas and MITM clients might prefer one result over another so it is recommended you do some testing. If you want a good starting point try **Brute Force**.

- Min Points
  - Minimum number of points that a cluster should have
- Cluster Mode
  - **Fast** - Uses an exponentially faster algorithm but returns worse results
  - **Balanced** - Middle option between Fast and Brute Force. Includes additional options to custom results
    - üöß Only unique üöß - Counts min points by unique points instead of all points in a Cluster
    - Sort By
      - Geo Hash - Creates a more human looking route where the next jump is closest in distance
      - Cluster Count - Prioritizes clusters with larger points of interest. IE - 4 spawn points in one jump will be earlier in the route over a jump that only includes 3 spawn points.
      - Random - Good old random.
  - **Brute Force** - Returns large jumps but it optimized on finding clusters. Is multithread optimized and will max available CPU in order to complete the operation as quickly as possible.
    - Cluster Split Level - Lower number will have better results while higher number will be faster as it is splitting the task over more CPU threads.

### Routing Options

- Route Split level
  - GeoHash Precision Level to split the route into smaller chunks for multithreading
  - `1` returns the most ideal routes
  - Higher levels will split the route into more chunks, which process much faster but may not be as ideal

### Saving

- Save to K≈çji Db
  - If the Polygon is saved to the database, this will auto save the calculated routes to the K≈çji database under the same name, using the category to auto set the `mode`
- üöß Save to Scanner Db üöß
  - Saves the route to the Scanner database, use with Calculation
- Skip rendering
  - Does not render the returned route to the map
  - This can be useful if you're bootstrapping large locations for example. If the returned route may freeze the browser, you can skip rendering and just save the route to the database
- Update
  - Starts the clustering

### Layers

  - Shows the circles that are drawn on the map
- Show polygons
  - Shows the polygons that are drawn on the map

### Markers

- Gyms
  - Shows the gyms on the map
- Pokestops
  - Shows the pokestops on the map
- Spawnpoints
  - Shows the spawnpoints on the map
- Pokestop Ranges
  - Shows the radius around the Pokestops that nearby Pokemon can be picked up from
- Query Type
  - `Bound` - loads markers based off of the current map bounds (screen)
  - `Area` - only loads markers within the drawn polygons
  - `All` - loads all markers from the database, be careful with this one
- Last Seen
  - Filters data by their `last_seen` or `updated` timestamp

### S2 Cells

- Display
  - `All` - displays all S2 cells currently within map bounds
  - `Covered` - displays S2 cells that are currently being covered by circles
  - `None` - does not display S2 cells
- Mode - determines how cell coverage should be evaluated
  - `Radius` - uses the circle radius to cover cells, allows multiple levels to be selected
  - `S2` - takes into account level and size, e.g. 9x9, only single level can be selected
- Fill
  - `Simple` - slightly better performance, only fills the outer border of the covered S2 cells
  - `All` - fills every individual cell, e.g. all 81 cells when in 9x9 mode
- S2 Level
  - Same as above
- S2 Size
  - Same as above
