# Getting Started

## Logging In

<Image src="/images/login.png" alt="login" width={600} height={600} />
When presented with this screen you login with the `KOJI_SECRET` you set in your
`.env` or `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Projects

A "project" in K≈çji is how you create custom endpoints for distributing your geofences to the various integrations. Lets quickly walk through the process of setting up a basic project to use with ReactMap.

1. Navigate to the Admin Panel by clicking the `Admin` button on the landing page.
1. Navigate to the `Projects` panel by clicking `Projects` in the left hand side drawer.
1. Click `Create` to start your new project.
1. Give your project a name, such as `ReactMap`.

   <Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
     If your project is your scanner, you can set `Scanner` to true by clicking
     the toggle switch.
   </Callout>

1. If your project supports a refresh endpoint to make it call K≈çji again for updated geofences, you can input the API endpoint here, as well as any headers. For this example, we will ignore these though.
1. Click `Save` to create your new project.
1. Below we will go through different ways you can import your existing fences and assign them to your new project.
1. Once you've completed those steps, your geofences assigned to this project will now be accessible at `http://{your_koji_url}/api/v1/geofence/feature-collection/ReactMap`
1. Projects don't have to be striclty used with external integrations though. K≈çji's client can also import geofences by project so it may be convenient to group them for this reason as well.

## Import existing Projects

1. After logging in, click the `Map` button on the landing page
1. Open up the drawer, and go to the Import panel
1. Click the `Import Wizard` button
1. In the `JSON` section, click `Browse` and select your desired file, such as the `areas.json` file from [ReactMap](https://github.com/WatWowMap/ReactMap) or `geofence.json` from [PoracleJS](https://github.com/KartulUdus/PoracleJS)
1. No matter what format you use, they will be converted into standard GeoJSON features
1. Click `Next`
1. If the features from your file have a `name` property that isn't called `name`, you can select which one K≈çji should use in step 2

   <Image
     src="/images/import_name.png"
     alt="Import Name Page"
     width={600}
     height={600}
   />

1. You can also select which properties you would like to save to the K≈çji database
1. There are two special actions, "Combine by Name Key" and "Split Multi Polygons"

   - "Combine by Name Key" will combine all features with the same name into one feature (rare)
   - "Split Multi Polygons" will split any MultiPolygons into multiple Polygons, this might be useful if your integration does not support MultiPolygons

1. Click `Next`
1. Now you can choose to assign each feature a `mode` and a project to be associated with. If you haven't already created a project, you can add one directly from this menu by typing in the name of the new project and clicking `Add {project_name}`

   <Image
     src="/images/import_mode.png"
     alt="Import Mode Page"
     width={600}
     height={600}
   />

1. Click `Next`
1. Same as above but for routes

1. At any point you can check out the current code generated and a preview of your features on a map

   <Tabs items={['Map', 'Code']}>
     <Tab>
       <Image
         src="/images/import_preview.png"
         alt="Map Preview"
         width={600}
         height={600}
       />
     </Tab>
     <Tab>
       <Image
         src="/images/import_code.png"
         alt="Code Preview"
         width={600}
         height={600}
       />
     </Tab>
   </Tabs>

1. Click `Save to K≈çji` to save all of the selected routes and fences to the respective tables in the K≈çji database

   <Image
     src="/images/import_save.png"
     alt="Import Name Page"
     width={600}
     height={600}
   />

1. Repeat for however many projects/files you want to import! The import wizard can import from all sorts of differnet sources, including Nominatim and shape files.
