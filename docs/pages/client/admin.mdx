## Projects

- Create, edit, and delete your various projects
- Geofences can be assigned to multiple projects at once
- Projects are used to determine API endpoints for external Integrations
- e.g. you name a project `react-map`, the API would be `https://www.koji.com/api/v1/feature-collection/react-map`
- You can also export entire projects to any of the supported formats
- Only set a single project as the scanner project

## Geofences

- Create, edit, and delete your various geofences

## Routes

- Create, edit, and delete your various routes

- **Route names do not have to be unique. If a route name shares the same name as its assigned geofence, its name will update if the geofence name is changed**
- You can sync routes to the scanner project as well

## Properties

- Create, edit, and delete your various properties
- Properties can be assigned to multiple geofences at once
- You can set a default value for a property if you want it to be easily assignable to multiple fences without having to set it manually
- If you set the property category to `database` it will use the value from the respect column in the `geofence` table. Common use case is for the `name` property, so you don't have to keep it updated in two places

## Tileservers
