## Projects

- Create, edit, and delete your various projects
- Geofences can be assigned to multiple projects at once
- Projects are used to determine API endpoints for external Integrations
- e.g. you name a project `react-map`, the API would be `https://www.koji.com/api/v1/feature-collection/react-map`
- You can also export entire projects to any of the supported formats
- Only set a single project as the scanner project

## Geofences

- Create, edit, and delete your various geofences
- Geofences can be assigned to multiple projects at once
- Multiple routes can be assigned to a single geofence
- Multiple properties can be assigned to a single geofences
- `Sync` button will attempt to sync the geofence with the designed scanner project
- Create properties in the properties tab before adding them to your geofence
- Every geofence must have a unique name

## Routes

- Create, edit, and delete your various routes
- A route must be assigned to a single geofence
- **Route names do not have to be unique. If a route name shares the same name as its assigned geofence, its name will update if the geofence name is changed**
- You can sync routes to the scanner project as well

## Properties

- Create, edit, and delete your various properties
- Properties can be assigned to multiple geofences at once
- You can set a default value for a property if you want it to be easily assignable to multiple fences without having to set it manually
- If you set the property category to `database` it will use the value from the respect column in the `geofence` table. Common use case is for the `name` property, so you don't have to keep it updated in two places

## Tileservers

These are completely optional. By default we will use `CartoCDN`.

- Create, edit, and delete your various tileservers
- Tileservers are used for selecting different map tiles from the K≈çji client
- Custom Tileservers can be self hosted with: [123FLO321/SwiftTileserverCache](https://github.com/123FLO321/SwiftTileserverCache)
- Any publicly accessible Tileserver can be used

Example URIs:

```

https://your_custom_tileserver/tile/pogo_day/{z}/{x}/{y}/2/png
